# Food for All

## Overview

**Food for All** is a community-driven platform designed to address the issue of food waste and hunger. By connecting restaurants, event organizers, and individuals with surplus food to those in need, we aim to reduce food waste and provide meals to those who cannot afford them.

## Project Background

This project was developed for the Open Source Community African chapter in Dar es Salaam. The goal was to utilize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to identify a problem and pitch a viable solution. Our focus was on addressing the **Zero Hunger** goal.

## Problem Statement

Many restaurants, events, and households often have leftover food due to various reasons, such as overestimating customer turnout or cooking in excess. Meanwhile, a significant number of people struggle to afford even a single meal a day. The lack of a structured system to redistribute this surplus food results in wastage and unaddressed hunger.

## Solution

**Food for All** provides a web-based platform where:

- Restaurants and event organizers can register and notify the community whenever they have surplus food.
- Individuals in need and centers can register to receive notifications about the availability and location of leftover food.
- Notifications are sent out to inform registered users about when and where food will be available for pick-up.

## Tech Implementation

The platform will consist of:

- **Restaurant and Event Registration:** Restaurants and event organizers can sign up and log in to notify the community about leftover food.
- **User Registration:** Individuals in need and collection centers can register to receive notifications about food availability.
- **Notification System:** Timely notifications will be sent to registered users when they should get to centers to get provided meals, and for restaurants, homes, and event organizers to confirm the availability of surplus food.

## Project Plan

Currently, **Food for All** is in the planning phase. We have outlined the basic functionalities and user interfaces in our design files. The next steps involve developing the platform and integrating the notification system.
